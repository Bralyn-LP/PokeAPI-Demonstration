# PokeAPI-Demonstration

***

This repository demonstrates my understanding of APIs and how you can import and organize data through them. In this instance, I used PokeAPI to display various statistics and informations with regards to pokemon, and made it interactive so the user can input the names of the pokemon they want to see info about.
